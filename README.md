This app is for Windows and automates tasks on a computer for purposes like RPA using computer vision. The main idea is that bigger tasks consist of smaller tasks, such as opening a webpage, which consists of opening the browser and going to the URL. 
Going to the URL is again a subtask of locating the URL bar and typing. The app will have simple actions like mouse movement, vision validators, conditions, and more, which can be implemented with automation libraries and computer vision.
The app will have an interface where the user can put together actions into a flow, where the new flow can again be used in other flows. The created flows will be saved to a database.
